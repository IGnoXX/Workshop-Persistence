# Workshop persistence
This is the first Uni-project I had during my CS studies. 
Task: Create a concurrent sales system for a Shop.

# What I've learned
* Java
* How to use transaction in SQL
* The 3-layer architecture (Model-, Controller- and GUI layer)
* Source control with multiple persons
* Team work
* Software planning using diagrams and mockups
* Writing a detailed report about the Project
* Planning is more important and most time consuming task compared to coding everything.
